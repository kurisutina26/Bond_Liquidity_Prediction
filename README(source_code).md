### BOND LIQUIDITY PREDICTION

#### I have coded the model in ipython notebook.

Here, there is:
1. Final_Try_BOND_65.40.ipynb
2. Final_Try_BOND_65.40.py(converted python file from ipython notebook)

In the notebook, I have documented the code snippets and also have shown the flow of our procedure.
I have used machine learning libraries including xgboost, pandas, numpy, scikit learn, etc.

The notebook is self explanatory. Also, due to multiple testing of models, I have already saved the generated data_train for data set which we merged with the metadata afterwards.
The code for generation of the data_train("MAIN_DF.csv") is also in the notebook. Its recommended to read the comments in the notebook while running it.

The accuracy obtained was 65.4045.
More further details about feature engineering and the model will be added later.
